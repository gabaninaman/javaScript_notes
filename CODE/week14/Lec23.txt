the web page has(is made of)

contet- text images, viedeo, animation(multi-media)-the language is english
structure- html
style-css
behaviour-javaScript     

these are the 4 aspects of the web page and every aspect has its own language

when you take a typical html document(containing some tags)
this html is on the server and when the browser requests the page the page is loaded on the browser
now each tags are converted in javaScript objects. 
this forms a tree, and after processing the html page is converted into Document Object Model(DOM)


When you say Head is a tag-->> more specific it is called tag entity

when you talk about p or paragraph tag-->> more specific it is called tag element

typical for for paragraph
<p>
blaaaaaaaaaaaaah
</p>

shortcut for paragrpah tag
<p x="10" y="20" />

XML- Extensible Markup language
Html has a fixed number of tags but, XML has more than html

XML is a technology which allows you to make your own markup language  
the personalized language which we make with XML is called xml applications
XML application-language you designed with xml

Smilimarly,
SGML application- language you designed with the help of sgml

when two application you designed are interacting with each other(eg- using hyperlink)
the protocol used for communcation can also be designed with xml and sgml

So, HTML is an SGML application




XHTML- is an XML apllication and is near to your original html. 
this is more flexible than html.

The DOMParser interface provides the ability to parse XML or HTML source code from a string into a DOM Document 

Parser- converts web page into DOM

Things to remember

Understanding the page abstraction
browser is the page renderer
server is a papge provider

then the four aspects of the page
content
structure
style
behaviour 


then the notion of the connection of the pages(www), aslo who gives us this notion(http applcations- browsers, servers, http protocol running on internet)
